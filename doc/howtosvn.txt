HOW TO BUILD QPM FROM SCRATCH
=============================

To configure the working environment:

1. Install the lastest QPM distro at folder C:\QPMdev from https://github.com/fyurisich/qpm
2. Install GitHub Desktop or another Git client and checkout the repository from
   * https://github.com/fyurisich/qpm
3. An alternative is to download a zip with all the files from the aforementioned site using the green button labeled  "Clone or download".
4. Install Harbour MiniGUI Extended Edition from https://sourceforge.net/projects/hmgs-minigui/
5. Install Borland C++ Compiler version 5.8.2 from:
   * http://www.xharbour.org/index.asp?page=download/windows/required_win
   * http://www.whosaway.com/
6. Start QPM, go to Settings/Global Options menu, select the tab labeled "Extended 1.x with Borland C", and configure the fields "MiniGUI Folder", "Borland C Folder" and "Harbour Folder" so they point to the folders created in steps 4 and 5.
7. If you didn´t installed at folder C:\QPMdev, you must modify, build and execute ./HelpQPM/SHG_Change.prg to change the path to the files used by QPM to build QPM.CHM help file. The building tools do not support relative paths so a full default path is specified (C:\QPMdev).
8. Launch CompileAll.bat to build all the binaries.


HOW TO BUILD A NEW RELEASE
==========================

         #define QPM_VERSION_NUMBER_BUILD   '00'

2. Open your working version of QPM and load ./QPM_AutoProject.qpm

3. If AUTOINC option is set to ON then change version, release and
    build to one less than the release to build.
    E.G. if you want to build 5.01.10, set QPM to 5.01.09
    if you want to build 5.01.00, set QPM to 5.00.9999
    If AUTOINC option is set to OFF then change version, release and
    build to the desired values.
