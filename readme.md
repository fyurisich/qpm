**Welcome to QPM**

QPM (QAC based Project Manager) is the Open Source continuation of the QAC
application developed by CarozoDeQuilmes (inspired on the MPM utility
designed by Roberto López, the creator of Harbour MiniGUI library).

QPM is a project manager for software applications
based on Harbour and xHarbour languages and its contributions, specialy the
graphic support libraries for Windows: Harbour MiniGUI, Harbour MiniGUI Extend
and Object Oriented Harbour GUI (OOHG), and Borland, Pelles and MinGW C/C++
compilers.

It assists programmers in the processes of program developing, compilation and
linkedition, providing tools (interactive and batch) for:

+ Incremental compilation of GUI, console and mixed type programs.
+ Building static libraries and DLL access interfaces.
+ Building CHM and HTML help files.
+ Visualizing Sources, Forms, Headers and DBFs.
+ Searching into Sources, Forms, Headers and DBFs.
+ Displaying the names of functions included in static and dynamic libraries.
+ Accessing external utilities to edit Forms and DBFs.
+ Executing aditional processes after build.
+ Compressing EXE files with UPX utility.
+ Visualizing error files resulting from compilation and execution.
+ Visualizing .PPO files resulting from preprocessor.
